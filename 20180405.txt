review:
DFS:acyclic directed graph yields no back edges
proof:
→: (u,v) is a back edge, v is  an ancestor of u, there is a path form v to u, the n there is a cycle;
←: suppose there is a cycle, v discovered first, at the time of d(v), all v in the cycle is white, from a white path from v to u, then u become a descendant of v, (u,v) is a back edge.
